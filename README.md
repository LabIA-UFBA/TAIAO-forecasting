# Environmental Monitoring in New Zealand: An In-Depth Exploration of Spatiotemporal Relation


This repository contains the code, data, and experiments related to the paper *Environmental Monitoring in New Zealand: An In-Depth Exploration of Spatiotemporal Relation*, [accepted](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PD05fBh0B1) to the [AAAI 2026 Workshop on AI for Environmental Science](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4es/home).

The project is structured to ensure **reproducibility**, **modularity**, and **comparative analysis** across different model families.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LabIA-UFBA/TAIAO-forecasting.git
cd repo_taio_aaai
```



**Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  
```



**Install dependencies**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## 🚀 Running the Models

Each model is implemented in a separate Python file inside the `code/` directory. For example:

```
python code/model_sarima.py
python code/model_lstm.py
python code/model_gru.py
python code/model_gnn.py
```



### 📈 Reproducibility notebooks

All experiments can be reproduced using the main notebook:

```
jupyter notebook notebooks/Cronos-t5-base.ipynb

jupyter notebook notebooks/TIMES_FM.ipynb
```

Forecast outputs are automatically saved under the `forecasting/` folder.

------

## 📊 Visualizing Results

The notebooks inside `notebooks/` allow you to reproduce, compare, and visualize results. Example:

```shell
jupyter notebook notebooks/CHEB.ipynb
```
